A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days. The idea is actually pretty simple. Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days. It turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit -- like watching the news -- from your life.

几年前，我觉得自己墨守成规，所以我决定追随伟大的美国哲学家摩根·斯珀洛克的脚步，尝试30天的新事物。这个想法其实很简单。想想你一直想添加到生活中的东西，然后在接下来的30天里尝试一下。事实证明，30天正是从你的生活中增加一个新习惯或减少一个习惯（比如看新闻）的合适时间。

There's a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges. The first was, instead of the months flying by, forgotten, the time was much more memorable. This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month. And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day. I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, my self-confidence grew. I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work. For fun!

在这30天的挑战中，我学到了一些东西。第一个是，与其说过去的几个月被遗忘了，不如说那段时间更令人难忘。这是我一个月来每天拍照的挑战之一。我清楚地记得那天我在哪里，在做什么。我还注意到，当我开始做越来越多、越来越难的30天挑战时，我的自信心增强了。我从一个呆在办公桌上的电脑迷变成了那种骑自行车上班的人。为了好玩！

Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges.

甚至在去年，我还徒步攀登了非洲最高的山峰乞力马扎罗山。在我开始30天的挑战之前，我从来没有这么冒险过。

I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough, you can do anything for 30 days. Have you ever wanted to write a novel? Every November, tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel, from scratch, in 30 days. It turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month. So I did. By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you've written your words for the day. You might be sleep-deprived, but you'll finish your novel. Now is my book the next great American novel? No. I wrote it in a month. It's awful.

我还发现，如果你真的非常想要某件事，你可以在30天内做任何事情。你曾经想写小说吗？每年11月，数以万计的人试图在30天内从头开始写自己的5万字小说。事实证明，你所要做的就是在一个月内每天写1667个单词。我照做了。顺便说一句，秘诀是在你写完一天的话之前不要睡觉。你可能睡眠不足，但你会读完你的小说的。现在我的书是下一部伟大的美国小说吗？没有。我在一个月内写的。太可怕了。

But for the rest of my life, if I meet John at a TED party, I don't have to say, "I'm a computer scientist." No, no, if I want to, I can say, "I'm a novelist."


但在我的余生中，如果我在TED派对上遇到约翰·霍奇曼，我不必说“我是一名计算机科学家。”

So here's one last thing I'd like to mention. I learned that when I made small, sustainable changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick. There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges. In fact, they're a ton of fun. But they're less likely to stick. When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this.

最后一件事我想提一下。我了解到，当我做出微小的、可持续的改变，我可以继续做的事情时，它们更有可能坚持下去。巨大而疯狂的挑战没有错。事实上，它们非常有趣。但它们不太可能坚持下去。当我戒糖30天的时候，第31天是这样的。

So here's my question to you: What are you waiting for? I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not, so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot! For the next 30 days.
Thanks.

我的问题是：你还在等什么？我向你保证，无论你喜欢与否，接下来的30天都会过去的，所以为什么不想想你一直想尝试的事情，试一试呢！接下来的30天。
谢谢。
